Interfaces: 
CoffeePriceCalculator: Defines methods for calculating the selling price of different types of coffee products.
DataStorage: Defines methods for storing and retrieving data from the cache or database. //this can be added


Services
Adapter Classes: Adapter classes allow us to adapt the interface of one class to another interface that a client expects. In our case, we could have adapter classes that implement the CoffeePriceCalculator for different coffee products:

GoldCoffeePrice: Implements the CoffeePriceCalculator for calculating the selling price of gold coffee products.
ArabicCoffeeAdapter: Implements the CoffeePriceCalculator for calculating the selling price of Arabic coffee products.

CacheService for Data Storage: This class is for the storing and retriving coffee sales data

Controller: 
CoffeeController : That acts as the intermediary between the user interface and the underlying business logic.
The controller interacts with the appropriate adapter class to calculate the selling price based on user input.
It also interacts with the caching layer to store and retrieve coffee sales data.

Unit Test : I have added unit test to test the gold coffe price for example


Improvements:

Tailwind CSS compoments for input attributes : Tailwind.css in new for me, I figuered out how it works however still some learning reruired.

Validation:
Implement request validation to ensure that incoming data is valid before processing it. 

Exception Handling:
Implement exception handling to gracefully handle errors and exceptions that may occur during the execution of the application. Use Laravel's exception handling mechanism to centralize error handling logic.

Security:
Adding input sanitization

Testing:
Write comprehensive unit tests to verify the behavior of individual components such as controllers, services, and adapters.
